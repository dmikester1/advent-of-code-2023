# Advent of Code 2023

This is my attempt at the 2023 Advent of Code.  I am using a Node Server on the backend to read in the input files and process them.  Then I am sending the answers back to the my front end which is written in React.  I made a nice festive front end for this project.  Having a lot of fun!
